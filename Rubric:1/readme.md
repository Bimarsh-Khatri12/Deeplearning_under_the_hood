Basic project demonstration iluustrating the application of neural network to achieve specific performance targets:
Classify Handwriiten digits with Neural network library (Tensorflow)
Rubric 1:
In this task, we used a feedforward neural network (also known as a multilayer perceptron, MLP) to classify images from the MNIST dataset, which consists of hand-written digits. The algorithm is structured to perform image classification by training a model on the provided image data, and then evaluating its performance on unseen test data.

Here how I achieved result from this task:

Data Preprocessing: The images are scaled to values between 0 and 1 by dividing by 255, normalizing them to improve model training.

Model Architecture: A neural network model is built with a flatten layer to convert the 28x28 pixel images into 1D vectors. The model includes one hidden dense layer with 128 neurons using the ReLU activation function and an output layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) using softmax activation to predict probabilities for each class (digit).

Training: The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer, which adjusts weights during training to minimize the loss (using sparse categorical cross-entropy) and maximize accuracy. The model is trained on the training data for 5 epochs with a validation split, meaning it evaluates its performance on a portion of the training data at each epoch.

Evaluation: After training, the model is evaluated on the test set to see how well it generalizes to unseen data. The final accuracy is printed to assess the model's performance.

In essence, the algorithm trains a neural network on labeled image data, learns to identify patterns in the pixel values, and outputs a classification (digit) for new, unseen images.
